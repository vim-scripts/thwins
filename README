Windows are always organised as follows:

===================
|                   |        S1        |
|     Main     |==========
|                   |        S2        |
===================

Mapped Keys:

<C-H> Make the current buffer as the main window
<C-L> Make current buffer displayed as full screen
<C-C> Delete current buffer
<C-D> Close all buffers except the current one
<C-J> Move cursor to next buffer
<C-K> Move cursor to previous buffer

Priority Rules for Buffers

Current > Main > Displayed > New opened > Others
